inbox_sweep.py — Phase-0 inbox triage for Apple Mail (all accounts, no cloud creds).

Why: the claude.ai Gmail MCP connector is read-only and the Gmail-API path needs `op`
(not signed in). Apple Mail holds every account authenticated and is AppleScript-
drivable, so it's the cheapest working apply lane. Reuses the vetted classifier +
protected-sender gate from core.rules and the MailAppProvider primitives.

The coarse Eisenhower tier alone over-flags (treats every Apple receipt / GitHub
usage notice / FICO update as a "fire"). So on top of the tier we apply an
ACTION-vs-NOISE refinement so only genuine action items + real humans + gov/legal
stay surfaced; receipts / marketing / usage-FYI are archived even from big-brand
domains. Three outcomes:

    FIRE    -> flag + keep in inbox (+ goes to the obligations ledger)   [surfaced]
    KEEP    -> leave in inbox untouched (protected, ambiguous)           [safe]
    ARCHIVE -> mark read + move to <noise mailbox>                       [noise out]

DRY RUN by default. --apply to act. Nothing deleted; noise → one reversible mailbox.
Fail-open: a single message error never aborts the sweep. Writes a JSON receipt.
