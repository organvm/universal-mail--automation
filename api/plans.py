"""Plan catalog + entitlements — the single source of truth for pricing & limits.

ONE table drives three consumers: the public ``GET /v1/billing/plans`` endpoint,
the generated ``pricing.md`` / ``llms.txt`` marketing artifacts, and the runtime
entitlement check that caps a triage run. A price or limit change is one edit here
— never a hunt across code, docs, and the website.

Design rule, straight from the market research: **the safety mechanism is never a
paywall.** The protected-sender gate and the independent audit receipt are
identical on every tier, including Free. We monetize REACH (run volume, providers,
agent access) and RETENTION (hosted receipt history) — never restraint. So the
``limits`` below bound *how much* you triage and *what you keep*, never *whether
the gate protects you*.

Stripe price ids are NOT hard-coded — each paid plan names the ENV VAR that holds
its price id (``STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`` etc.). The ids live in the Stripe dashboard and
are injected as deploy secrets, so this file is safe to commit and the price→plan
mapping for the webhook is derived from the environment at runtime.
