"""protocols.py — the outbound decision cascade: protocol → precedent → exploration.

Given a surfaced obligation (a "fire" row: sender, subject, label, tier), derive the
KNOWN NEXT STEP without a network call or an LLM. Three rungs, tried in order:

    1. PROTOCOL    — a recurring class with a codified next step + draft intent
                     (loan-default, billing-decline, fraud-alert, kyc, legal-sign …).
    2. PRECEDENT   — no protocol, but a real human / known correspondent → reply by
                     precedent (a person who wrote you is owed a human reply).
    3. EXPLORATION — unknown → a research/verify next step until the action is certain.

This module only DECIDES the rung and emits the concrete, owned next step (+ an
optional draft intent). It never sends or mutates mail. The hard ideal-form synthesis
for the actual reply text — when protocol+precedent are silent — is left to a keyless
``claude -p`` pass downstream; this is the deterministic spine that says which rung
applies and what the human's single next move is.

Design notes:
- Every obligation is owned by HIM ("yours") — the system surfaces, it never acts.
- `verify` marks a class that is phishing-prone (fraud/credential-change notices): the
  next step leads with "confirm the sender is real" before any action, so a spoof can
  never steer a real action. The raw display name never drives the decision.
- Priorities are derived from consequence (money/legal/security > infra > marketing),
  not from the sender's brand — a generic "payment failed" outranks a recruiter.
