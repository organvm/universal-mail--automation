"""FastMCP server — the mail-triage engine as safety-gated agent tools.

Every tool delegates to :mod:`api.service`, the single chokepoint that enforces
the fail-closed protected-sender gate and the independent audit receipt. So an
agent driving these tools physically cannot get a "success" result if a protected
sender was archived — the guarantee is inherited, never re-implemented. This
inverts the 68+ existing Gmail MCP servers, which expose raw archive/delete with
no decision-layer restraint.

Two design choices that matter:
  * the destructive ``triage`` tool defaults to ``dry_run=True`` — the opposite of
    the ecosystem default — so a careless or prompt-injected agent previews by
    default and must *explicitly* ask to mutate;
  * a gate violation raises (``AuditInvariantError`` → MCP ``isError``) rather than
    returning success, and the message is generic so internal message ids never
    leak to the model.

Run:
    python -m mcp_server                         # stdio (Claude Desktop, etc.)
    uvicorn mcp_server.server:http_app           # hosted Streamable HTTP at /
