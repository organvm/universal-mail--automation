"""Top-level ``platform`` package for the universal-mail SaaS layer.

⚠️  This package shares its name with the Python standard-library ``platform``
module. Because the project root is on ``sys.path`` (see ``pyproject.toml``'s
``pythonpath = ["."]``), a bare ``import platform`` can resolve to THIS package
instead of the stdlib module. Many third-party libraries (uvicorn, httpx,
setuptools, …) rely on ``platform.system()`` / ``platform.uname()`` at import
time, so to avoid breaking them this ``__init__`` transparently re-exports the
genuine standard-library module's public API. The project's SaaS REST entrypoint
lives in :mod:`platform.saas_runner`.

Currently it also includes :mod:`platform.checkout`, which receives the
``license-issued`` webhook and persists the granted license for the local engine
to read (see ``core/license.py``).

The submodule is also importable directly from its file path (the test-suite
loads it that way), which keeps it independent of import order between this
package and the stdlib module.
